# Installing the Electrod compiler

Installation has been tested on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X. It most probably does
not work on MS Windows.

## Installation through OPAM (preferred)

The easiest way to install "electrod" is to rely on the OPAM OCaml package
manager.

You need at least OCaml version 4.04.2.

Just type `opam install electrod` in a shell; after installation, you will see a
program called "electrod" in your PATH.
