A model finder for relational first-order linear temporal logic (RFOLTL).

Electrod is a model finder inspired by Kodkod. It takes as input a
model expressed in a mixture of relational first-order logic (RFOL)
over bounded domains and linear temporal logic (LTL) over an unbounded
time horizon. Then it compiles it to a problem for a solver (currently
the NuSMV and nuXmv tools) to produce example or counter-example traces.

Electrod is mainly meant to be used as a backend for the more abstract
language Electrum (inspired by Alloy).
